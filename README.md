- 👋 Hi, I am Amparo Alías, a 23 years old Mathematical Engineer with 3 years of experience. 

- 👀 I am interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP models and data analytics. In this Github you will find part of the work I do during my free time to learn more about this world. 

- 🌱 During my working experience I have been able to learn a vast variety of techniques and to manage different projects, interacting with the final client and the developers. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to broaden my horizons by sharing ideas and code with people as passionate for data science as myself.

- 📫 You can reach me by sending me a mail to _amparoalias2205@gmail.com_
